description: |
  This feature is applied by the Indic shaper during the typographic presentation
  phase, and is intended to "clean up" dead consonant sequences which have not
  been formed into conjuncts, by replacing them with correct dead consonant forms.


  For example, consider the two sequences "tta nukta virama ra" and "tta nukta virama"
  without the final ra. In Noto Sans Devanagari, the "tta nukta virama" sequence is
  first composed into `ttanuktadeva` by the `nukt` feature, leaving
  `ttanuktadeva viramadeva radeva` and `ttanuktadeva viramadeva` respectively.


  When the final ra is present, the `rkrf` feature creates a conjunct form
  `ttanuktaradeva`. But without the final ra, we are left with `ttanuktadeva viramadeva`.
  In this case, the default positioning of the nukta underneath the tta is
  incorrect, as it needs to move to the left to accommodate the virama. A
  precomposed glyph `ttanuktaprehalfdeva` is substituted in the `haln`
  feature to tidy up this dead consonant sequence.
