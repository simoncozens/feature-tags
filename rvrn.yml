  OpenType Font Variations provides for the ability for different features to
  apply at different point of the variation space. For example, consider a
  font with a weight axis - when the weight is greater than 600, the designer
  wants the `dollar` glyph to be substituted for a simplified form to avoid
  crowding the internal counterspace. This facility is called "feature variation",
  and because it is implemented by substitution, it allows for different portions
  of the variation space to represent the same character using different glyphs
  and therefore different outlines; this in turn means that designers can implement
  variations without being forced to make the outlines compatible between
  dramatically different forms.


  According to the OpenType specification, feature variation can be applied to
  *any* feature. However, Microsoft registered the `rvrn` feature specifically
  for processing feature variations early in the shaping process. This may not
  turn out to be the best approach, as future rules now need to take into account
  not just the original glyph but any substitutions; it may be better to perform
  design-specific substitutions *after* all orthographic substitutions have between
  completed.


  Both Harfbuzz and CoreText process feature variations in features other than
  the `rvrn` feature. I have not been able to ascertain whether or not the Microsoft
  shapers process feature variation tables in other features. If they do - and
  if font creation tools allow for creating feature variation tables in other
  features - then this feature could be considered technically redundant.
