title: Contextual Swash
registered: Adobe
state: discretionary
description: |
  This feature is similar to the `swsh` (Swash) feature, but is intended to be
  used for contextual (conditional) swash substitutions. For example, while
  Adobe Garamond Pro Italic uses the `swsh` feature to substitute *all*
  capitals for swash forms, it uses the `cswh` feature to conditionally change
  only capitals preceding a lowercase into swash forms.
