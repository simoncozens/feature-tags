description: |
  This feature - by analogy with the `rtla` feature - is intended for
  right-to-left scripts which can also be expressed in a left-to-right line
  layout, but which require glyph transformations such as mirroring when
  written left-to-right. As detailed in the `ltrm` feature, such scripts
  are extremely rare, and no implementations have been found.
