  This feature is used by the Arabic and USE complex shapers as part of topographic
  shaping. It is designed to replace joining characters with isolated forms. This means characters
  which have the Unicode joining type `Right_Joining` or `Dual_Joining` in a
  right-to-left script, and characters which have the Unicode joining type `Left_Joining`
  or `Dual_Joining` in a left-to-right script. These joining type properties
  can be found in [`ArabicShaping.txt`](https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/ArabicShaping.txt)
  in the Unicode Character Database.
