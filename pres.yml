description: |
  This feature is used in Indic, Khmer, Myanmar and USE scripts to form pre-base
  conjunct ligatures. For example, in Devanagari or Gujarati, the sequence
  `ka + virama + consonant` is first substituted by the half form `k + consonant`
  in the `half` feature, but then is further ligated to a conjunct form in this
  feature.


  The feature may also be used for other presentational adjustments
  concerning pre-base forms, such as selecting the correct width of the i-matra.
