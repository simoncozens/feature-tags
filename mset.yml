description: |
  This feature is used by the Arabic shaping as the final phase of the typographic
  shaping group. It was intended for substitutions which combine marks and bases
  into precomposed forms as an alternative to using positioning rules in the `mark`
  feature; however, it is possible to use *substitution* rules in the `mark`
  feature, making the `mset` feature redundant.

  It was used in Microsoft's Windows 95 Arabic fonts, and practically no other font.
  New fonts should use `mark`, `ccmp`, `rlig` or other features instead.
