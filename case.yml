  This features is intended to reposition glyphs (either by substitution or
  positioning), particularly punctuation glyphs, so that they are better
  aligned within all-capital sequences or sequences of lining numerals.
  It should also change oldstyle numerals to lining numerals.


  Note that while it was hoped that layout engines would automatically apply
  this feature within all-capital sequences, this is not currently known to
  be automatically applied, and must be applied manually by the typesetter.
