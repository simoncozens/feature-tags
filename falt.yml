title: Final Glyph on Line Alternates
registered: Microsoft
description: |
  This feature was intended to allow a justification system to substitute a
  glyph for another form when the glyph is the final one on a line of text,
  to improve the fitting of the line. (See also `jalt`.) No known layout
  engine supports activating this and it is unclear whether any fonts
  implemented the feature.
