title: Right Bounds
registered: Adobe
status: deprecated
description: |
   This feature was intended as part of the implementation of character
   protrusion (see `opbd`); the idea being that it would be applied to the final
   character on a line to alter the bounds of that character allowing it to
   protrude into the right margin. However, this would require an interaction
   between the line breaking engine and the shaping engine which has only once
   been implemented, in the LuaTeX layout system.


   This feature should therefore be regarded as prematurely specified and
   hence deprecated.
