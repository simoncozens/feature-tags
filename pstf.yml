description: |
  This feature is intended to replace glyphs by their post-base forms. For example,
  in Bengali and Gurmukhi, the ya consonant has a post-base form when followed
  by a virama.

  Note that in the Indic shaper, this feature is also used as a "signal" to the shaping engine for reordering
  purposes: that is, if a virama-consonant pair would be substituted by this feature,
  then that consonant is placed in the post-base position when the syllable is reordered.
