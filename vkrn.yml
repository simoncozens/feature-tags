title: Vertical Kerning
registered: Adobe
description: |
  This feature is the equivalent to kerning (see `kern`) for vertical layout, with
  the exception of the fact that this is *not* necessarily applied by default.
  Harfbuzz does not apply it by default in vertical settings, and font designers
  should consider using the `vert` feature instead for maxium compatibility.
