  This feature produces half forms of conjuncts. It is processed in the Indic
  and USE complex shapers as part of the orthographic shaping group.


  Half forms are used in scripts such as Devanagari to display dead (unvoiced)
  consonants after a virama in conjuncts which do not have a predetermined
  conjunct form. Half forms should be provided for all base consonants. These
  half forms can then be substituted into conjuncts later using the `pres`
  feature. For example:

  ```
  feature half {
    sub ka-deva halant-deva by k-deva;
    ...
  } half;
  feature pres {
    sub k-deva sa-deva by ksa-deva;
    ...
  } pres;
  ```
example:
  font: Hind
  text: ग्त
state: required
done: true
fea: |
  feature half {
    sub ka-deva halant-deva by k-deva;
    sub kha-deva halant-deva by kh-deva;
    sub ga-deva halant-deva by g-deva;
    sub gha-deva halant-deva by gh-deva;
    ...
  } half;
