description: |
  This feature substitutes digits for lining forms. Lining figures are
  designed to fit in all-capital settings.

  In theory, this feature should not just substitute the default form
  of figures (e.g. `one`, `two`) for lining forms, but also any alternate
  non-lining forms (such as oldstyle figures) for lining forms. Where
  lining forms are the default, implementing a substitution from oldstyle
  figures to lining figures is not typographically necessary but will cause
  the UI of layout programs to display lining figures as an option.

  See also `onum`, `pnum`, `tnum`.

  In the OS X typography panel, this feature is accessed via "Number Case >
  Lining Figures". In Adobe applications, selecting "Tabular lining" from the
  OpenType panel will apply this feature and the `tnum` feature, while selecting
  "Proportional lining" will apply this feature and the `pnum` feature.


  In CSS, this feature can be accessed through the `font-variant-numeric: lining-nums` property.
