  This feature is used in *very particular circumstances*. Despite its name, it
  is not a general mechanism for activating italic glyphs.


  Historically CJK fonts, particular Japanese fonts, shipped with a glyphset
  which contained the Latin alphabet (usually full-width but sometimes proportional).
  As will as upright forms, these fonts *also* included Latin italic glyphs.


  CJK fonts with both upright and italic Latin glyphs in the same font should use
  this feature to select the italic forms

  In the OS X typography panel, this feature is accessed via "Italics -> On".
  In Adobe applications, this feature is accessed via "Roman Italics" in the OpenType panel.
  Note that in neither case can the italic feature be accessed from the "Italicise"
  button or the "Font Style" menu.
