description: |
  This feature is intended to replace base + post-base sequences with a ligature
  glyph. It can also be used to perform any contextual post-base substitution
  required (for example, in Devanagari or Bengali, replacing the ii-matra (ी)
  with appropriate width glyphs to point to the stem of the consonant).
