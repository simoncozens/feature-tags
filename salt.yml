title: Stylistic Alternates

description: |
  Prior to the introduction of multiple stylistic sets (see the `ss01` feature),
  this feature was used to select alternate aesthetic forms of glyphs which do
  not correspond to the descriptions of other features. Currently, this feature
  is generally implemented by font editors either by replicating the rules of `ss01`
  or by combining *all* stylistic alternate substitutions.


  Stylistic sets (`ss01`...`ss20`) should be used in current fonts in preference
  to this feature, as UI support for the `salt` feature is not always available.
