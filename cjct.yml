description: |
    This feature is applied to Indic scripts and scripts using the Universal
    Shaping Engine as the final feature in the orthographic unit shaping phase,
    before final reordering. It was intended for use in creating consonant
    conjunct groups. (Consonant + Virama + Consonant.)  The context of application
    is restricted to a syllabic cluster.


    The difference between this feature and `blwf` is that the `blwf` feature
    is intended for substituting the "tail" (virama + consonant) for a below-base
    form, while this feature is intended for substituting the entire sequence
    with a ligature.
