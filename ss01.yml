title: Stylistic Set 1 - Stylistic Set 20

description: |
  These features - ranging from `ss01` to `ss20` - allow for stylistic variations
  of *sets* of characters to vary in a common way. This is distinct from the
  `cv01`-`cv99` features which allow characters to vary arbitrarily with no
  implication of any common variations across a range of glyphs.


  For example, in the font Cormorant, stylistic set 01 changes the terminals
  of capital letters; stylistic set 02 opens the counters of glyphs with
  counters; stylistic set 03 replaces double-storey glyphs (`g`, `a`) with
  single-storey forms, and so on.


  When this feature is coded manually, stylistic sets may be given
  identifying names to be displayed in the user interface. See the
  [Adobe feature file specification](http://adobe-type-tools.github.io/afdko/OpenTypeFeatureFileSpecification.html#8.c)
  for the format of these names.


  These features are an extension to (and repacement for) the `salt` feature,
  which only provides access to a single stylistic set.
