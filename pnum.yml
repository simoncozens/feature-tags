title: Proportional Figures
registered: Microsoft/Adobe
automatic: true
description: |
  This feature replaces tabular (fixed-width) figures by proportional variants.
  See also the `onum`, `lnum` and `tnum` features. Note that where the default
  form is proportional, this feature has no effect, although some font editors
  provide rules for this feature in any case.
