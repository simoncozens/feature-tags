description: |
  This feature replaces consonant+virama with the reph form of the consonant.
  In Devanagari, non-final ra+virama should be substituted by reph. The context
  of application is restricted to a syllabic cluster.


  Note that in the Universal Shaping Engine, this feature is also used as a
  "signal" to the shaping engine for reordering purposes: after this feature
  has been processed, any glyphs substituted in by this feature are considered
  to have USE category `R`.
