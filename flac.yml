  This feature replaces accents with flatter forms allowing them to fit within
  the line when placed over a tall base character. This feature is automatically
  applied by the math layout engine when an accent is placed over a base character
  at a height of more than `MATH.MathConstants.FlattenedAccentBaseHeight`.
