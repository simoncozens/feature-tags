title: Right-to-left alternates
registered: Adobe
state: required
group: Preprocessing
order: 2
description: |
  This feature is applied to right-to-left texts as part of the glyph preprocessing
  stage. It is intended for substituting variants which are appropriate for
  right-to-left text, but which are not mirrored substitutions. (Mirrored forms
  of glyphs should be handled by the `rtlm` feature.)


  No examples of this feature being used as described have been found; Noto
  Sans Tifinagh uses the feature to mirror glyphs when Tifinagh is being set
  right-to-left (e.g. when used to write Tuareg).
done: true
example:
  font: Noto Sans Tifinagh
  text: ⵎⵉⴷⴷⵏ
