description: >
  Substitutes lowercase characters for petite capitals. Petite capitals are
  an additional set of capital letters found in some founds which are smaller
  than the "small caps" set, designed to harmonize better with the lowercase
  letters. (See, for example, [Mrs Eaves](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/mrs-eaves) and
  [Filosophia](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/filosofia).)


  Compare with `c2pc`, which substitutes uppercase letters for petite capitals.


  Note that as this feature changes the case of the glyph, font engineers should
  ensure that any language-specific localisations are taken into account during case
  conversion - for example, when applying this feature to the letter `i` in
  Turkish, the returned form should appear with a dot above. (This is often
  achieved by replacing i with `idotless dotaccent` or similar in the `locl`
  feature.)
