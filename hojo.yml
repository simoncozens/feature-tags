title: Hojo Kanji Forms (JIS X 0212-1990 Kanji Forms)
registered: Adobe
description: |
  The expected form of Japanese kanji characters in an OpenType font are the
  forms specified in JIS X 0213 (which replaces the older standard, JIS X
  0208). As well as JIS X 0208, an additional standard, JIS X 0212, defined
  supplementary characters, including 5,801 kanji characters. 2,743 of those
  characters were included in the JIS X 0213 standard, but in some cases,
  the representative forms are different between the 1990 revision of JIS X
  0212 and the current revision (2004) of JIS X 0213. This feature is used to
  select the JIS X 0212-1990 representative forms of these characters.


  The best source of information about which glyph forms differ, and how this
  feature should be implemented, is the
  [Adobe-Japan1](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/Adobe-Japan1) repository.
