title: Traditional Forms
registered: Adobe
description: |
  The expected forms of Japanese kanji have evolved and simplified over time. However,
  in particular situations - often in the display of personal names - older,
  "traditional" forms (*kyujitai*) are still preferred. This feature allows a user to enter
  text as normal (i.e. with the Unicode codepoint for a more common, simplified
  form) but have it substituted typographically for the traditional glyph. For
  example, to typeset the name Sakae as 榮 (a variant found in south west Japan),
  the user would enter the reading さかえ in their input method environment, and
  have it converted to 栄, the usual kanji for this word. Applying the `trad`
  feature would replace 栄 with 榮.


  Note that where traditional forms have their own Unicode codepoints, using these
  codepoints directly is preferred, to avoid ambiguity and to preserve the distinction
  in the source text. In some cases (for example, the traditional form of 朗),
  *kyujitai* were not separately encoded in Unicode due to Han unification, and
  so the `trad` feature is necessary to access these glyphs.


  The expected substitutions of the `trad` feature are defined in terms of the
  [Adobe-Japan1](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/Adobe-Japan1) glyphset.
  Engineers creating Japanese fonts according to that glyphset should read the
  information at the Adobe-Japan1 repository, and use the latest version of the
  feature code provided there to implement this feature.
