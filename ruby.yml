  In Japanese typesetting, words written in kanji may be superscripted by
  the kana transliteration of the words to aid with reading. (In vertical
  settings, the transliteration is placed to the right.) These subscripted
  kana, called *furigana* or ruby, are scaled down to a reduced size relative
  to the main text. Scaling and positioning is applied by the typesetting
  engine, but the font may wish to provide alternate forms of the kana
  when they are being used in a ruby context - for example, slightly bolder
  forms such that they will maintain the correct weight when scaled down to
  ruby size, or different forms that are more legible when displayed at a
  smaller size.
