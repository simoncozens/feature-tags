  This feature is one of the two facilities for kerning within OpenType.
  The original TrueType `kern` *table* in the font implements simple,
  non-contextual pair-based and class-based kerning, and a pair-based (format 0)
  `kern` table was historically required for kerning to function in applications
  such as Microsoft PowerPoint.


  However, modern fonts tend to implement kerning through the use of
  this feature instead (see [discussion](https://typedrawers.com/discussion/comment/15218)).
  The standard implementation is to use GPOS 2 pair positioning rules to adjustment
  the X advance of the first glyph in the pair, although note that when
  generating a `kern` feature for right-to-left text, the adjustment is
  generally made to both advance *and* placement:

  ```
  pos period parentheses <-30 0 -30 0>;
  ```


  See also the `vkrn` feature for kerning in vertical settings. Kerning may
  be disabled based on user preference; for mandatory adjustments, use the
  `dist` feature instead.

  In the OS X typography panel, this feature is *disabled* via "Text Spacing >
  No Kerning".
