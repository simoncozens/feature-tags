title: JIS04 Forms
registered: Adobe
description: |
  The expected form of Japanese kanji characters in an OpenType font are the
  forms specified in JIS X 0213 (which replaces the older standard, JIS X
  0208). In the course of revision of this standard, the expected forms of a
  number of kanji characters have changed over time.


  Fonts should target the most recent revision of the standard (currently the
  2004 revision). However, features may be used to access forms specified in
  earlier revisions. If the `jp04` feature is applied, kanji should be
  replaced by variant forms representing those specified in the 2004 revision
  of the standard. As 2004 is the current revision, this feature should only
  be implemented when providing updates to older fonts or to provide remappings
  for glyphs where both older and newer forms are encoded in Unicode and provided
  in the font (for example, `sub uni5516 by uni555E;`).


  A historical comparison between different character forms in JIS revisions
  can be found at [this site](http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~ax2s-kmtn/ref/jisrev.html).
