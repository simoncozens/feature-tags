  The Korean Hangul script is encoded in Unicode in two ways: first, as a series
  of precomposed syllable graphemes (encoded from U+AC00 to U+D7AF); second, as
  a series of indivdual, conjoining *jamo*. Korean syllables form a LVT?
  (leading consonant, vowel, optional trailing consonant) pattern; the leading consonant
  (*choseong*) jamo are encoded between U+1100 and U+115F, the vowel (*jungseong*)
  jamo are encoded between U+1160 and U+11A7, and the optional trailing consonant
  (*jongseong*) jamo between U+11A8 and U+11FF. (At least in the primary Hangul
  Jamo Unicode block; other jamo are encoded in extension blocks.)


  The Hangul shaper will first attempt to compose any sequences of conjoining jamo
  into an encoded form in the precomposed syllable block. But where this is not
  successful - for example, in an Old Korean form which is not encoded in Unicode
  as a precomposed syllable - then the shaper will instead *decompose* any LV
  syllables to break the syllable into separate L, V, and T? characters, and then
  apply the Korean shaping features (`ljmo`, `vjmo`, `tjmo`) to select forms of
  the jamo which are appropriately positioned and sized to combine into the correct
  grapheme-image.


  For example, the Old Korean syllable ᄒᆞᆯ is not encoded in Unicode as a precomposed
  syllable, and so must be encoded with the three individual jamo. The Hangul
  shaper applies the `ljmo` feature to the *choseong*, the `vjmo` feature to the
  *jungseong* and the `tjmo` feature to the *jongseong*. The resulting sequence
  produces a glyph which renders the syllable correctly, with the `vjmo` and
  `tjmo` generally producing zero-width mark glyphs positioned appropriately. An
  alternative to this technique is to use the `ccmp` feature to turn decomposed
  jamo into a precomposed glyph.
