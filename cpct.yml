title: Centered CJK Punctuation
description: |
  This feature is intended to center punctuation (typically the ideographic
  comma 、 and ideographic full stop 。) in Chinese fonts. Where presented, it
  is often implemented as GPOS lookup 1 positioning rules to place these
  glyphs within the center of the em square.
example:
  text: 我、你
  font: Kaiti
registered: Adobe
done: true

  feature cpct {
     pos comma-han <328 350 0 0>;
     pos period-han <359 350 0 0>;
  } cpct;
