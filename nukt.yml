description: |
  This feature is used to replace `consonant + nukta` with a precombined nukta
  form glyph in Indic and USE scripts. It is called during the preprocessing
  group - after initial reordering in Indic scripts, but before processing in the
  USE.


  While nukta marks may be positioned using the normal mark positioning functionality
  (`mark`), the font designer may choose to create specific precomposed nukta glyphs,
  either for ease of positioning or to facilitate later lookups.
