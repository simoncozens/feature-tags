    This feature is used by the Arabic complex shaper when processing the Syriac
    script. The Syriac letter alaph (U+0710) has multiple final forms: the first
    final form, used when the preceding character is a joining
    character, is selected using the `fina` feature, similar to an Arabic alif.


    However, when the preceding character is a non-joining character, the selection
    of the final form of alaph depends on whether the preceding character has
    joining group `Dalath_Rish`. If the preceding character (skipping all characters
    with a transparent joining group) is either U+0715 (dalath), U+0716 (dotless
    dalath rish) or U+072A (rish), the `fin3` feature is applied. Otherwise,
    this feature is applied.
