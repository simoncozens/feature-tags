  In the OS X typography panel, this feature is accessed via "Uppercase ->
  Small Capitals." In Adobe applications, this feature is accessed via "All
  Small Caps" in the OpenType panel (although this also turns on `smcp`).


  In CSS, this feature can be set with `font-variant-caps: all-small-caps;`
  (although this also turns on `smcp`).
