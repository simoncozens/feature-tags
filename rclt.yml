title: Required Contextual Alternates
registered: Microsoft
description: |
  This feature is intended for required contextual alternates (contextual
  alternates which should not be subject to user control). Note that in the
  Arabic shaper it is processed early in the typographic presentation phase;
  in other shapers, it is processed along with the common feature group.


  In the example, Reem Kufi uses the `rclt` feature to swap repeated *beh*
  glyphs for glyphs with raised teeth.
