    This feature has two distinct uses.


    It was originally intended for ligature forms which are contextual in nature,
    for example, for Latin script fonts, and typically made up of GSUB lookup 8 rules.
    However, these rules may also be placed in other discretionary ligature
    features, such as `rlig` or `liga`, and these should be used instead. As such
    this use is relatively rare.


    Separately, in the Khmer complex shaper, this is a mandatory feature used
    for "ligatures that are desired for typographical correctness". It is
    therefore used widely in Khmer fonts for general typographic shaping.
