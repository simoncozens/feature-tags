title: Simplified Forms
registered: Adobe
description: |
  This feature was intended for converting Chinese or Japanese glyphs to simplified forms.
  No fonts implementing this feature have been identified and it is not
  specified in the Adobe Japan1 glyph set. As with the `hngl` feature,
  character semantics should be selected using the input method environment,
  rather than the font, and hence this feature is discouraged.
