description: |
  This feature - by analogy with the `rtlm` feature - was intended for
  right-to-left scripts which can also be expressed in a left-to-right line
  layout, but which require glyph transformations such as mirroring when
  written left-to-right.


  Such scripts are exceptionally rare. Noto Sans Old Hungarian uses this
  feature to horizontally mirror the glyphs when laying out Old Hungarian
  left-to-right, although it is disputed that Old Hungarian was ever written
  left-to-right. The Old South Arabian script is usually written RTL but
  can also be laid out LTR; but Noto Sans Old South Arabian does not include
  mirroring substitutions. Oh well.
