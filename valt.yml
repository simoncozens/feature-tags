title: Alternate Vertical Metrics
registered: Adobe
status: discouraged
description: |
  The intention behind this feature was to reposition full-width glyphs
  (e.g. U+FF01-U+FF60) so that they would be visually
  centered inside the em-square in vertical typesetting context.


  However, a more appropriate way to achieve this visual repositioning is to
  supply alternate metrics for these glyphs in the `vmtx` and `VORG` tables.
  As such, this feature has only been implemented extremely rarely, and,
  despite the description in the OpenType standard, Harfbuzz does not apply
  it by default in vertical layout.
