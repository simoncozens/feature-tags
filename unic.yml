title: Unicase
registered: Tiro Typeworks
description: |
    This feature was intended for mapping both upper- and lowercase letters
    to a "unicase" alphabet, a set of glyphs with a common glyph height using
    a mix of upper- and lowercase glyph forms. (For example, a font may use
    the lowercase style of `a` but the uppercase style of `B`, but both glyphs
    will have the same height; see Bradbury Thompson's [Alphabet 26](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradbury_Thompson#Alphabet_26)
    or Zuzana Licko's [Filosofia Unicase](https://www.emigre.com/Fonts/Filosofia).)
