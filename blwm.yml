title: Below-base Mark Positioning
registered: Microsoft
group: Common
description: >
  This feature allows for mark positioning, similar to the `mark` feature; it
  was intended for positioning marks which are placed below a base consonant in
  a syllabic script, but while the OpenType Specification describes this feature
  as being used for Indic scripts, Harfbuzz applies the `blwm` feature as
  part of common feature processing for all scripts.


  The only distinction between this feature and the `mark` feature is a subtle
  one: in `blwm` processing, any ZWJ characters are skipped when matching input
  and any ZWNJ characters are skipped when matching context, whereas in `mark`
  processing, ZWJ/ZWNJ characters are not skipped. Other than that, the choice
  of `blwm` versus `mark` is a matter of notational convenience for the engineer.


  See also `blwm`.
