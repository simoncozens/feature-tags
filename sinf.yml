description: |
  This feature replaces glyphs with subscript forms, similar to the `subs` feature,
  but in theory for a wider range of glyphs (including Latin letters),
  generally for chemical or mathematical notation.


  Also, in theory, subscript numerals should sit on the baseline, while scientific
  inferiors should bisect the baseline

  In practice, the same substitutions are often made as those in the `subs` feature.
example:
  font: Alegreya
  text: H2O

  In the OS X typography panel, this feature is accessed via "Vertical Position >
  Scientific Inferiors".
