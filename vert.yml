title: Vertical Alternates
registered: Microsoft/Adobe
state: required
group: Typographic
description: |
  This feature is applied automatically by the shaping engine at the end of
  required processing and before discretionary processing when the script
  direction is set to vertical; it replaces the horizontal positioning and
  typographic presentation group (`calt`/`clig`/`curs`/`dist`/`kern`/`liga`/`rclt`).


  It should be used to replace any glyphs with forms which are more appropriate
  to vertical presentation. For example, punctuation such as ellipses and parenthesis
  should be replaced with rotated forms, Japanese small kana should be positioned in the
  upper right quadrant of the em square, and Japanese ligature forms (U+32FF-33FF) should
  be replaced with versions which preserve reading order when read vertically.


  Note that, aside from supporting CJK vertical presentation, this feature
  should also be used for typographic presentation rules for fonts supporting
  other vertical writing systems, such as Mongolian.


  Not also that if the `vrt2` feature is present, this feature will be used instead
  by Microsoft shaping engines. Indeed, Windows 2000 and NT4.1 *require* the use
  of a `vrt2` feature for CFF-outline fonts. However, Harfbuzz and Adobe shapers
  use `vert` exclusively. See discussion in `vrt2`.
