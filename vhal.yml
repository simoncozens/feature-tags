title: Alternate Vertical Half Widths
automatic: true
state: discretionary
registered: Adobe
description: |
  This feature is similar to the `halt` feature, in that it re-spaces full-width
  glyphs to fit on a half-em, but `vhal` is used in vertical typesetting,
  re-spacing heights instead of widths.
