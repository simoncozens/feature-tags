description: |
  This feature is used to position glyphs with cursive connections.


  Certain scripts, in particular Arabic, are "connected" scripts, where the
  start of a character has its position adjusted relative to the end of the previous
  character. In font editors, this is normally defined by setting "exit" and
  "entry" anchor points. These are then converted to GPOS 3 cursive positioning
  rules.


  While this feature is not mandatory for designers - some styles of Arabic
  are aligned along the baseline, and so glyphs do not need to be repositioned
  - it is applied by default if present, and is not specific to Arabic script.
  It is not impossible, but exceptionally uncommon, to use this feature for
  connected "cursive" Latin fonts, and is often unnecessary because of the
  presence of a fixed baseline in Latin.
example:
  font: Aref Ruqaa
  text: سمر

    pos cursive uni0640 <anchor 250 35> <anchor 0 35>;
    pos cursive uni06A1.medi <anchor 606 35> <anchor 0 35>;
    # ...
  } curs;
