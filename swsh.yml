  This feature is used to replace glyphs with swash forms - typically, but not
  exclusively, swash capitals. Although the OpenType standard suggests that
  multiple swash alternates may be selected by providing a GSUB3 (`sub ... from ...`)
  rule for this feature, in reality most implementations expect a single swash
  alternate, and users may have difficulty accessing glyphs other than the first
  alternate. For this reason, we recommend using GSUB1 (`sub @chars by @chars.swsh`)
  rules for this feature.


  See also the `cswh` feature for contextual swash forms.
example:
  font: Playball
  text: Fake It

  In the OS X typography panel, this feature is accessed via "Contextual
  Alternates > Swash Alternates".
