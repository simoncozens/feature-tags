description: |
    This feature is used by the Arabic complex shaper when processing the Syriac
    script. The Syriac letter alaph (U+0710) is not normally a joining character
    but can join to the right in the middle of a word if the preceding character
    is right-joining.
example:
  font: Noto Sans Syriac
  text: ܒܐܬܪܐ
