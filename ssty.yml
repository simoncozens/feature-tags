  This feature is used by the math layout engine to select glyph variants
  used in subscripts and superscripts. When the engine lays out a glyph as
  a superscript or subscript, it will first determine the script level: 1
  for first-level sub-/superscripts and 2 for higher levels. It will then
  supply the script level as a parameter to a GSUB3 alternate substitution
  rule in this feature to obtain the correct glyph variant.


  The glyph variant will then be scaled by the math layout engine based on
  the factor specified in the MATH table (`MATH.MathConstants.scriptPercentScaleDown`
  for first-level sub-/superscripts and `MATH.MathConstants.scriptScriptPercentScaleDown`
  for higher level scripts). As the scaling will be performed by the layout
  engine, the form of the glyphs substituted in this feature should not be
  scaled or repositioned. For example, the STIX Math Two font shown in the
  example uses slightly bolder script alternates so that the glyph weights
  appear consistent when scaled down.
