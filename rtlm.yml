  When a bidirectional text is being laid out, any characters which have the
  `Bidi_Mirrored` Unicode property and whose directionality is resolved to RTL
  will be replaced by their mirrored equivalents. This mirroring is specified
  by the [Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm](https://unicode.org/reports/tr9/#L4),
  and is performed by the layout engine prior to shaping.


  However, a font may contain mirrored glyphs for characters which do *not* have
  the `Bidi_Mirrored` property (and thus are not handled by the Unicode bidirectional
  algorithm), but which are required to be mirrored when displayed in right-to-left settings.
  For example, mathematical characters such as the square root sign (√) and
  intergral sign (∫) do not have mirrored forms encoded in Unicode, but should be
  mirrored in right-to-left text.
