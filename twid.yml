description: |
  This feature replaces glyphs (normally figures and punctuation) with variants
  which are one-third of the em square. This is generally used with CJK fonts
  and in the context of vertical typesetting. (For placing a sequence of three
  numbers horizontally across an em-width vertical column.)

  See also `fwid`, `hwid`, `qwid`.
