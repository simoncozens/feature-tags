title: Optical Bounds
registered: Adobe

description: |
  This feature was intended for implementing what TeX users call "character
  protrusion" or "margin kerning": improving the fit of lines in a paragraph by
  altering the apparent advance width or positioning of certain characters
  based on their optical edges rather than bounding boxes.


  Consider, for example, a serif letter D appearing at the beginning of a line.
  By altering the positioning of the glyph, the serifs can be protruded outside
  the margin so that the stem aligns with the left edge of the text, to give a
  more visually "tight" justification.


  This feature was originally intended to automatically "call" the `lfbd` and
  `rtbd` features to achieve margin kerning; however, the OpenType feature
  model did not develop as planned, and so this feature was never implemented.
