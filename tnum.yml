registered: Microsoft/Adobe

description: |
  This feature replaces proportional figures by tabular (fixed-width) variants.
  See also the `onum`, `lnum` and `pnum` features. Note that where the default
  form is tabular, this feature has no effect, although some font editors
  provide rules for this feature in any case.
