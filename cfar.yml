description: |
  This feature is only applied during orthographic unit shaping in the Khmer
  complex shaper. In Khmer, the conjunct form of the letter ro (after a
  coeng) is reordered to the left of the base consonant and displayed as a
  deep letterform which can interact with below-base glyphs. This feature
  was intended as offering an opportunity to fix up below-base glyphs to
  avoid clashing with the coeng ro.


  No examples of the use of this feature have been found. Consider using
  `blws` instead.
