title: Standard Ligatures
registered: Microsoft/Adobe

description: |
  Ligatures provide typographic refinement by replacing multiple glyphs with a
  single, ligated form. This feature is used for standard ligatures, which are
  to be applied by default; in Latin text, this is generally sequences such as
  `f f`, `f f l`, `f f`, `f i`, and `f f i`.

  Ligature code is often automatically generated by the font editor based on
  detecting sequences of glyph names combined with underscores; note, however,
  that the common ligature glyph `fi` does *not* contain an underscore.
