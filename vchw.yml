title: Vertical Contextual Half-width Spacing
registered: Adobe/W3C
description: |
  This feature is the vertical equivalent of `chws`; it is intended to improve
  the appearance of text set with software which does *not* implement the full
  JLREQ spacing rules, but does implement vertical typesetting.

  This feature is relatively new as of 2021, no implementations have been
  identified, and to be honest, any layout engine which bothers to support
  vertical typesetting correctly is probably also going to implement JLREQ
  spacing as well.
