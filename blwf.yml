  Replaces below-base forms with special forms. This feature is applied by
  Indic, Khmer, Myanmar and USE complex shapers as part of the orthographic unit
  shaping phase. The context of application is restricted to a syllabic cluster.


  This is intended to be used for halant conjuncts, where consonant-virama-consonant
  sequences cause the second consonant to be displayed below the first.


  Note that in the Indic shaper, this feature is used as a "signal" to the shaping engine for reordering
  purposes: that is, if a virama-consonant pair would be substituted by this feature,
  then that consonant is placed in the below-base position when the syllable is reordered.


  See also `blws` which applies to the whole run, rather than per-cluster.
