title: Vertical Alternates for Rotation
registered: Adobe/Microsoft/W3C
description: |
  This feature is intended to select alternate glyphs to be used in vertical
  typesetting. When the `writing-mode` CSS property is set to `vertical-lr`
  or `vertical-rl`, certain glyphs are rotated 90 degrees clockwise by the
  rendering engine.

  However, prior to rotation, the font may wish to substitute glyphs which
  are designed for vertical settings. These glyphs will still be rotated by
  the rendering engine, but will be visually distinct from the original forms.


  This feature is relatively new as of 2021, and no implementations have been
  identified.
