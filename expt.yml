title: Expert Forms
registered: Adobe
description: |
  This feature is used to substitute Japanese kanji for alternative forms which
  are considered more "typographical". This includes the use of JIS78 forms
  (see `jp78`), but also a wide range of other substitutions.

  The expected substitutions of the `expt` feature are defined in terms of the
  [Adobe-Japan1](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/Adobe-Japan1) glyphset.
  Engineers creating Japanese fonts according to that glyphset should read the
  information at the Adobe-Japan1 repository, and use the latest version of the
  feature code provided there to implement this feature.

  (Thanks to Ken Lunde for the information about implementing this feature.)
