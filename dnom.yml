description: |
  This deprecated feature replaces numeric glyphs with denominator forms. See also `numr`.

  Note that, despite the description of this feature in the OpenType specification,
  the application of the `frac` feature is independent of this feature. It was
  originally intended that applying the `frac` feature would "trigger" the
  application of the `numr` feature for glyphs before the division slash and
  the `dnom` feature for glyphs after it. This behavior was never implemented in
  OpenType shaping, and instead contextual rules are used within the `frac` feature
  to choose appropriate glyphs for numerator and denominator.

  New fonts should use the `frac` feature in preference to this feature.
