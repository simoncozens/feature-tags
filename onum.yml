description: |
  This feature substitutes digits for oldstyle forms. Oldstyle figures are
  designed to fit in mixed case text settings.

  In theory, this feature should not just substitute the default form
  of figures (e.g. `one`, `two`) for oldstyle forms, but also any alternate
  lining forms (such as lining figures) for oldstyle forms. Where
  oldstyle forms are the default, implementing a substitution from lining
  figures to oldstyle figures is not typographically necessary but will cause
  the UI of layout programs to display oldstyle figures as an option.

  See also `onum`, `pnum`, `tnum`.

  In the OS X typography panel, this feature is accessed via "Number Case >
  Old-Style Figures". In Adobe applications, selecting "Tabular oldstyle" from the
  OpenType panel will apply this feature and the `tnum` feature, while selecting
  "Proportional oldstyle" will apply this feature and the `pnum` feature.
