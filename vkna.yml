title: Vertical Kana Alternates
registered: Adobe
state: discretionary
description: |
  This feature replaces standard kana forms with glyphs which are designed
  specifically for vertical layout. This may take a variety of forms: fonts
  designed with proportional kana might provide fixed-width em-square kana
  glyphs; glyphs may be raised from the horizontal baseline and centered
  within the em-square; or structural changes may be made analogous to the
  `hkna` feature. In many fonts, vertical alternates are only provided for
  the "small" kana.
example:
  font: Cherry Bomb One
  text: シャットアップ

  feature hkna {
    sub ka-hira by ka-hira.vkna;
    sub sa-hira by sa-hira.vkna;
    sub ta-hira by ta-hira.vkna;
    # ...
  } hkna;

  In the Mac OS X typography panel, this feature is accessed via "Optimized
  Kana Alternatives -> Vertical Alternatives".
