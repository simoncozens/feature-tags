title: Vertical Alternates and Rotation
status: discouraged
registered: Adobe
description: |
  This feature was intended as a replacement for the `vert` feature. The idea
  was that this feature would contain rules for vertical alternates as per `vert`
  and also rules which replace Latin glyphs by rotated forms; this would mean
  that the layout process for vertical text would be greatly simplified:
  the layout engine could simply apply the `vrt2` feature to both CJK and
  Latin text, and not need to rotate any glyphs.


  However, this model of layout [was not widely accepted](https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/harfbuzz/2013-August/003490.html),
  and the older `vert` feature continues to be the most compatible approach to
  vertical typesetting. For that reason, the use of this feature is *discouraged*
  in favour of `vert`.
