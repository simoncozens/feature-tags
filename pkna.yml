title: Proportional Kana
registered: Adobe
state: discretionary
description: |
  Japanese characters are usually typeset on a fix-width em square grid. However,
  for display purposes, it may be preferable to set the glyphs proportionally.
  This feature either replaces the kana glyphs with alternate glyphs with reduced
  sidebearings, or uses positioning rules to achieve the same effect. See also
  `pwid`.
