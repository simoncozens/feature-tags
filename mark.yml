description: |
  This feature is used to position mark glyphs with respect to their base glyphs.


  Generally speaking, this is automatically generated by font editing software
  based on the positions of anchors in the base and mark glyphs. The editor will
  emit mark-to-base (GPOS4) and mark-to-ligature (GPOS5) rules for this feature.
example:
  font: Markazi Text
  text: تَشْكِيل
done: true
