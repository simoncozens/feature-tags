description: |
  This feature replaces glyphs with "notational" forms - glyphs in boxes,
  circles, etc. It is often used in CJK fonts to access characters in the Unicode
  "Enclosed CJK Letters and Months" block (for example, `sub uni3131 by uni3200;`),
  but may also be used to access other enclosed forms (`sub one by uni2460;`).


  Note that although the OT Specification describes this as implementable via
  alternate substitution lookups, no interface supports this, and single substitutions
  should be used instead.
