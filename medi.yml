  This feature is used by the Arabic and USE complex shapers as part of topographic
  shaping. It is *not* appropriate for general middle-of-word detection, but is
  designed to replace joining characters with medial forms. This means characters
  which have the Unicode joining type `Right_Joining` or `Dual_Joining` in a
  right-to-left script, and characters which have the Unicode joining type `Left_Joining`
  or `Dual_Joining` in a left-to-right script. These joining type properties
  can be found in [`ArabicShaping.txt`](https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/ArabicShaping.txt)
  in the Unicode Character Database.
