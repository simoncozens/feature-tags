description: |
  This feature is used in the Indic and USE complex shapers to replace
  consonant clusters involving "ra" with conjunct forms. For example, in Devanagari,
  the sequence `ka virama ra` should be replaced by the conjunct form `kra`.
  While this substitution was previously achieved in the v1 shaper by the combination
  of the `bwlf` and `vatu` features, the v2 shaper allows for a simpler way to
  substitute the entire sequence.


  The `half` feature is processed after this feature, so any conjuncts created
  in `rkrf` must also be included in the half-form rules in `half`.
