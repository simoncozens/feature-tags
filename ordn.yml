  In some languages, alphabetic glyphs are used to abbreviate ordinal numerals.
  For example, in Italian, the word for "second" is written 2º when referring
  to a gramatically masculine noun and 2ª when referring to a gramatically
  feminine noun. While this can be encoded with the Unicode FEMININE ORDINAL INDICATOR
  (U+00AA) and MASCULINE ORDINAL INDICATOR (U+00BA) codepoints as in this
  paragraph, it is more common to use the standard Latin `a` and `o` characters
  and use a font feature to form the ordinal indicators.

  Additionally, the numero sign (№, U+2116) is more commonly written with the
  Latin sequence `No.`. This feature is applied to convert it to the numero
  glyph.

  Some fonts also use this feature to place other Latin glyphs in "ordinal
  position".
