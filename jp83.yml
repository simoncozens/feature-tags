title: JIS83 Forms
registered: Adobe
description: |
  The expected form of Japanese kanji characters in an OpenType font are the
  forms specified in JIS X 0213 (which replaces the older standard, JIS X
  0208). In the course of revision of this standard, the expected forms of a
  number of kanji characters have changed over time. For example, between
  the 1983 and 1990 revisions, the "eight" radical (*hachigashira*) changed form,
  losing its top horizontal line.


  Fonts should target the most recent revision of the standard (currently the
  2004 revision). However, features may be used to access forms specified in
  earlier revisions.


  A historical comparison between different character forms in JIS revisions
  can be found at [this site](http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~ax2s-kmtn/ref/jisrev.html).


  If the `jp83` feature is applied, kanji should be replaced by variant forms
  representing those specified in the 1983 revision of the standard.
