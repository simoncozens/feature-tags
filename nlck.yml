title: NLC Kanji Forms
registered: Adobe
description: |
  In 2000, the Japanese National Language Council (now the Japanese language
  division of the Agency for Cultural Affairs) prescribed new glyph forms for
  Japanese kanji. In particular, the shape of the "father" and "long stride"
  (*innyo*) radicals changed to remove a small stroke.


  The expected substitutions of the `nlck` feature are defined in terms of the
  [Adobe-Japan1](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/Adobe-Japan1) glyphset.
  Engineers creating Japanese fonts according to that glyphset should read the
  information at the Adobe-Japan1 repository, and use the latest version of the
  feature code provided there to implement this feature.
example:
  text: 咬廻挺爺
  font: Shippori Mincho
