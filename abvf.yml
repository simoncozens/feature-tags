  Replaces above-base forms with special forms. This feature is applied by
  Indic, Khmer and USE complex shapers as part of the orthographic unit
  shaping phase. The context of application is restricted to a syllabic cluster.

  This feature was originally intended for a specific use case in Khmer, the
  OE vowel sign (U+17BE, ◌ើ), which has pre-base and above-base components.
  The shaping engine [decomposes](https://github.com/n8willis/opentype-shaping-documents/blob/master/opentype-shaping-khmer.md#22-matra-decomposition)
  U+17BE into a pair of characters, U+17C1 (េ) and U+17BE (again). It then
  reorders the syllable to put the pre-base vowel part before the base consonant,
  leaving the U+17BE after the base. The font is responsible for turning the
  remaining ◌ើ glyph into the above-base part (ី), hence the example
  implementation below.

  However, more generally, this feature is a good home for above-base
  substitutions such as choosing alternate widths of an above-base vowel mark.

  See also `abvs` which applies to the whole run, rather than per-cluster.
