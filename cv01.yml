title: Character Variant 1 â€“ Character Variant 99
registered: Microsoft
state: discretionary
automatic: true
description: |
  These features - ranging from `cv01` to `cv99` - allow for stylistic variations
  of individual characters.

  They are similar to the Stylistic Set (`ss01`--`ss20`) features, but (as their)
  name implies, stylistic sets are intended to allow a *set* of glyphs to
  vary in a common way (for example, straightening the "leg" of glyphs such as
  `hnm`, or overlining `MCXLVI`  characters to form Roman numerals).
  Character variant features, on the other hand, do not imply any common
  variations across a range of glyphs.


  When this feature is coded manually, character variant features may be given
  identifying names to be displayed in the user interface. See the
  [Adobe feature file specification](http://adobe-type-tools.github.io/afdko/OpenTypeFeatureFileSpecification.html#8.d)
  for the format of these names.
example:
  font: Source Code Pro
  text: Java
fea: |
  feature cv01 {
    cvParameters {
        FeatUILabelNameID {
            name 3 1 0x0409 "single-storey a";
            name 1 0 0 "single-storey a";
        };
        Character 0x61;
    }
    sub a by a.cv01;
  } cv01;
