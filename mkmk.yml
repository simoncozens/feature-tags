title: Mark-to-Mark Positioning

description: |
  This feature is used to position mark glyphs with respect to other mark glyphs.
  This can be used for example to position arbitrary combinations of marks used
  in scholarly transliteration systems, as well as positioning
  Arabic secondary marks relative to primary marks, such as *fathah* over *shadda*
  and vice versa.


  Generally speaking, this is automatically generated by font editing software
  based on the positions of anchors in the mark glyphs, if the mark glyphs have
  both a "mark anchor" (e.g. `_bottom`) *and* an "attachment anchor" (`bottom`).
  The editor will then emit mark-to-mark (GPOS6) rules for this feature.
example:
  font: Work Sans
  text: 'é̤̤̱̃̃'
done: true
