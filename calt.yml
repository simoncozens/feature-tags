title: Contextual Alternates
registered: Adobe
state: default
group: Typographic
description: >
  This feature is used to substitute glyphs with alternate forms, generally on
  a contextual basis. For example, a script font may wish to use joining forms
  of the letter `o` when followed by another letter starting at the x-height.

  This feature is processed as part of the standard typographic presentation group;
  in the Indic and Arabic complex shapers, it is processed as part of the language
  form group.
