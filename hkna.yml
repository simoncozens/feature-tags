title: Horizontal Kana Alternates
registered: Adobe
state: discretionary
description: |
  This feature replaces standard kana forms with glyphs which are designed
  specifically for horizontal layout. For example, while "generic" kana may
  have curving crossbars for characters such as さ and た, horizontal variants
  may use straight crossbars.
example:
  font: Feature Sans
  text: か12か

    sub ka-hira by ka-hira.khna;
    sub sa-hira by sa-hira.khna;
    sub ta-hira by ta-hira.khna;
    # ...
  } hkna;

  In the Mac OS X typography panel, this feature is accessed via "Optimized
  Kana Alternatives -> Horizontal Alternatives".
