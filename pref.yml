  This feature is intended to form pre-base ligatures. In the Indic shaper, its
  application is scoped to
  the virama-consonant pair ordered before the base consonant. It is most often
  used in Khmer fonts to replace the `coeng ro` sequence with a pre-base form
  of the ra (see also `cfar`), or as a generic orthographic feature in Myanmar (Burmese).


  Note that in the Indic shaper, this feature is also used as a "signal" to the shaping engine for reordering
  purposes: that is, if a virama-consonant pair would be substituted by this feature,
  then that consonant is placed in the *post*-base position when the syllable is reordered.
  (Note: not the pre-base position, as one might expect!)
