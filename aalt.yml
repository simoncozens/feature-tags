title: Access All Alternates
registered: Adobe
done: true
description: |
  Allows the end user to access glyphs which are either not available, or not
  easily available, via other feature applications. The expectation is that this
  feature will allow substituting a glyph with all possible "alternative" forms
  of the glyph provided in the font: for example, for the glyph `a`, it will
  provide a substitution to small capital forms, swash alternates, superior forms,
  and so on. This is normally achieved through one-from-many (GSUB3) substitutions,
  but where only a single alternate is provided, the use of a one-to-one (GSUB1)
  substitution may be appropriate.


  A layout application will not apply this feature in the ordinary course of layout,
  but may use it to implement a "glyph picker" interface allowing the end user
  to choose the desired substitution, or to cycle through the alternates available
  for a glyph. Because of way that the layout application will apply this feature,
  it is undefined what would happen to lookup types other than GSUB1 and GSUB3 if
  placed inside an `aalt` feature.


  *Note*: AFDKO feature syntax offers special handling of the `aalt` feature.
  Within the context an `aalt` feature block, the `feature` keyword can be used
  to reference the lookups of other features, arrange any GSUB1 or GSUB3 rules
  within those lookups by glyph, and combine them into one-from-many rules.
  This allows the engineer to more easily generate an `aalt` feature by
  combining the effects of other features.


  For example, given a feature `smcp` which contains the rule `sub b by B.sc;` and a
  feature `salt` which contains the rule `sub b by b.alt;`, the effect of


  ```fea
  feature aalt {
    feature salt;
    feature smcp;
  } aalt;
  ```

  would be to create the rule `sub b from [b.alt B.sc];`.
