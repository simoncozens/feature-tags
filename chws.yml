title: Contextual Half-width Spacing
registered: Adobe/W3C
description: |
  Layout engines which correctly support advanced typographic layout for CJK
  (see [JLREQ](https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/), [CLREQ](https://www.w3.org/TR/clreq),
  [KLREQ](https://www.w3.org/TR/klreq/)) will contain code to adjust the spacing
  of glyphs in certain circumstances. For example, punctuation sequences such as
  `。」` should be set with the full-stop taking up a half-em width instead of
  a full em.

  This feature is intended to improve the appearance of text set with software
  which does *not* implement these spacing adjustments, by moving the spacing
  logic into the font.

  This feature is relatively new as of 2021, and no implementations have been
  identified.
