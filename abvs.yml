description: >
    This feature is intended for substituting base glyphs and above marks
    with ligature forms, but may be used for any standard typographic
    substitutions; engineers may wish to restrict its use to substitutions
    concerning above-base marks for organisational purposes. As a typographic
    substitution, it will be applied after the `abvf` feature.


    This feature is applied by the shaper as part of the standard typographic
    presentation phase for Indic scripts, Khmer, Myanmar, and scripts using the
    Universal Shaping Engine. It is applied with a per-syllable context for
    Indic scripts, but applied across the whole run in other scripts.
