title: Ornaments
description: |
  This feature has two uses, both of which are used to select ornament glyphs
  from within the font's glyphset.


  In the first use, all ornamental glyphs (fleurons, manicules, dingbats and
  so on) are made available through a GSUB3 alternate substitution from the
  bullet character (U+2022).


  In the second use, ASCII characters are substituted for ornamental forms using
  a GSUB1 substitution.
