  This feature is intended to replace consonant + below-base (vattu) sequences
  with ligature forms for fonts supporting the legacy (v1) shaping engine.


  For example, in Devanagari, the `<virama> <ra>` sequence is normally replaced
  by a below-base Ra by the `blwf` feature. However, "for certain consonants,
  the mark RAsub may graphically combine with the consonant to form a conjunct
  ligature form." (Unicode Standard, [section 12.1](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/ch12.pdf), "Rendering Rules", R7.)
  This combination is performed by the `vatu` feature in the v1 shaping engine
  (e.g. `deva` script).


  For fonts using the new shaper (`dev2`), the `rkrf` feature is used instead to
  substitute the whole `<consonant> <virama> <ra>` sequence for a ligature in one rule.
  Fonts which wish to support both v1 and v2 shapers should provide both `rkrf`
  (in the `dev2` script) and `blwf`/`vatu` (in `deva` script).


  As an orthographic feature, the scope of application of this feature is
  scoped to each syllabic cluster.


  Note that this feature is also used as a "signal" to the shaping engine for reordering
  purposes: that is, if a virama-consonant pair would be substituted by this feature,
  then that consonant is placed in the below-base position when the syllable is reordered.
