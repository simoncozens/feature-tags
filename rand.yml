  The randomize feature, which is *currently only implemented in the Harfbuzz shaping engine*,
  allows font designers to randomly replace glyphs with variants from a selection,
  using a GSUB3 alternate substitution. This can be useful for handwriting or
  display style fonts. This feature is applied by default (at least in Harfbuzz),
  and there is no user interface to disabling it; use tastefully.


  Note that because of the limited implementation of this feature, it is still
  recommended to use one of the other deterministic alternate selection strategies
  described in the [OpenType Cookbook](http://opentypecookbook.com/common-techniques/#randomization)
  in a `calt` feature. Also note that to avoid problems with reflowing text,
  the Harfbuzz shaping engine applies the same random seed to each shaping run.
  This means that while the glyphs within a run are chosen (pseudo)randomly, the
  results will be consistent each time the same text is shaped.

    # But you probably want to use one of the OpenType Cookbook recipes
    # in a calt feature instead
    sub A from [A a.rand1 A.rand2 A.rand3];
  } rand;
example:
  font: Feature Sans
  text: AAAA
