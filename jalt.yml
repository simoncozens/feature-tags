title: Justification Alternates
registered: Microsoft
state: discretionary
description: |
  This feature is intended to allow text layout engines to improve line justification
  by selecting alternate glyphs. A layout engine can set a line of text, and then
  try applying the `jalt` feature to the line to see if the resulting glyphs have
  a better fit. It is rarely implemented in layout engines, with Adobe InDesign
  and Photoshop being the only known implementations.

  In Adobe InDesign, this can be automatically applied at the paragraph level by choosing
  "Justification" from the paragraph panel menu and selecting "Justification Alternates
  (Naskh)" in the Justification dropdown. It can also be manually applied at the character
  level by choosing the Justification Alternate option from the character panel
  menu.

  In Adobe Photoshop, it can be manually applied at the character level by choosing
  "Justification Alternates" from the character panel.
