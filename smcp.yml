title: Small Capitals
registered: Adobe
state: discretionary
automatic: true
description: >
  Substitutes lowercase characters for small capitals. Small capitals are often
  used to set acronyms. Compare with `c2sc`, which substitutes uppercase
  letters for small capitals.


  Note that as this feature changes the case of the glyph, font engineers should
  ensure that any language-specific localisations are taken into account during case
  conversion - for example, when applying this feature to the letter `i` in
  Turkish, the returned form should appear with a dot above. (This is often
  achieved by replacing i with `idotless dotaccent` or similar in the `locl`
  feature.)

  In the OS X typography panel, this feature is accessed via "Lowercase ->
  Small Capitals." In Adobe applications, this feature is accessed via "All
  Small Caps" in the OpenType panel (although this also turns on `c2sc`).


  In CSS, this feature can be set with `font-variant-caps: small-caps;`
